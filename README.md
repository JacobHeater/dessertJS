A *powerful*, *feature-rich*, *easy-to-use* client-side **MVC** framework for building **awesome** web applications!

## Quick Start

- Ensure that you have the NodeJS runtime installed. If you don't, get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- In a command line window, navigate to the repository directory `<RepositoryDirectory>\dessertJS`.
- Run `npm install`, which will install the dessertjs package from the `package.json` file.
- Run `node server`, which will start the express server, and open a new chrome window with the app running.
- Begin using the example `country search` app.
- Implement your own app using dessertJS. **`:-)`**

## Usage Examples

There are plenty of usage examples in the `examples directory` of the project which go into great detail about how to
build robust web applications using the framework. All usage examples can be deployed locally using the `npm install`
instructions listed above, or you can go to the [Heroku app](https://dessertjs.herokuapp.com) online and see the examples running live there.
