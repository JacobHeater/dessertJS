    <h1>dessertJS by Example</h1>
    <br />
    <h3><a href="./countries">Country Search Example</a></h3>
    <p>A simple example showing how to use the <code>element.dsrt.repeat()</code> method to load a template for a data set.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3><a href="./package">Event Driven/Module Package Example</a></h3>
    <p>A simple example showing how to create a packageable, event driven module that makes dessertJS modules even more reusable.</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3><a href="./singlepage">Single Page Application (SPA) Example</a></h3>
    <p>A simple example showing how to create single page applications with dessertJS using dessertJS' built in routing helpers.</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3><a href="./books">Book Search Example</a></h3>
    <p>A simple hybrid example of templating with single page application capabilities to highlight the ease-of-use of creating complex applications with little effort.</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3><a href="./multiapp">Multiple Application Example<a></h3>
    <p>
        An example showing how to embed multiple applications in a single dessertJS parent application. This example shows how you
        can abstract core functionality into their own applications. This would be useful in situations where you would want to 
        reuse entire applications. Modules are already a great way to abstract functionality, but modules are coupled to their
        applications. When you want to reuse functionality that isn't tied to a specific application, it would be better to 
        abstract that logic into a separate application.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good example of this is seeing how I have created a parent app that hosts child apps, like the calculator.
